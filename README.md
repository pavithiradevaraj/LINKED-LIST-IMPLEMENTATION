Description:

This C program implements a singly linked list with operations for insertion, deletion, and traversal. Here's how each part works:

1.Node Definition:

A Node structure is defined with two fields: data (to store the integer value) and next (a pointer to the next node).

2.Node Creation:

The createNode function dynamically allocates memory for a new node, initializes its data, and sets its next pointer to NULL.

3.Insertion Operations:

At Beginning: The insertAtBeginning function inserts a node at the start by updating the head pointer to point to the new node.


At End: The insertAtEnd function traverses the list to find the last node and appends the new node.
4.Deletion Operation:

The deleteNode function deletes a node by value. It handles cases where the node to be deleted is the head or any other node. If the node isn't found, a message is displayed.
